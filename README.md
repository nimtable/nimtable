## Overview

Nimtable helps you easily manage and explore Apache Iceberg catalogs. With a web-based platform designed for clarity and simplicity, Nimtable makes it easy to browse tables, run queries, analyze file distributions, and optimize storage layouts.


### Key Features

- 🌟 **Multi-Catalog Support**: Connect to Hive Metastore, PostgreSQL (via JDBC), REST Catalog, AWS Glue, and S3 Tables.
- 🔍 **Table Exploration**: Inspect table schemas, partitions, and snapshots.
- ⚡ **Interactive Querying**: Execute SQL queries directly from the platform.
- 📊 **File Distribution Analysis**: Visualize how data files are distributed across partitions and snapshots.
- 🔧 **Table Optimization**: Run file compaction and manage snapshot expiration.
- 🔌 **REST Catalog Compatibility**: Serve as a standard Iceberg REST Catalog, adapting any underlying catalog to a RESTful API.

## Architecture

Nimtable acts as a bridge between users and catalog servers, providing both an interactive web interface and a standard REST Catalog API layer.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using Docker:

```bash
cd docker

# Start the service
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the service
docker compose down
```

Access the UI at http://localhost:3000

## Configuration

Nimtable uses YAML for configuration, supporting both server settings and catalog connections. The configuration format is compatible with Spark's Iceberg catalog configuration. You can configure catalogs in two ways:

1. **Configuration File**: Configure catalogs via YAML configuration (recommended for experts)
2. **Web Interface**: Configure catalogs through the Nimtable UI (recommended for new users)

To configure the Docker deployment, read the sample configuration file at [docker/docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml).

### Server Configuration

```yaml
server:
  port: 8182
  host: 0.0.0.0
admin:
  username: admin
  password: admin
database:
  url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/nimtable_db
  username: nimtable_user
  password: password
```

### Database Configuration

Nimtable needs a PostgreSQL database to store data.
If you deploy with the `docker-compose.yml` file,
a Postgres container is included.

You can also use your own Postgres database by setting the `url`, `username`, and `password`
in `config.yaml`.

### Catalog Configuration Examples

You can connect catalogs to Nimtable by clicking `CREATE CATALOG` in the UI.
There are multiple example templates provided to help you get started.

Alternatively, the catalogs can be pre-configured in the `config.yaml` file.
Refer to [config.yaml](./backend/config.yaml) for examples.

### AWS Credential Configuration in Docker

There are two ways to configure AWS credentials in Docker:

1. Using Environment Variables:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  nimtable:
    environment:
      - AWS_REGION=us-east-1
      - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
      - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

2. Mounting AWS Credentials File (Read-only):
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  nimtable:
    volumes:
      - ~/.aws/credentials:/root/.aws/credentials:ro
```


## Development
